REM       Searched out the MoS article "How to Calculate the Number of IOPS and Throughput of a Database (Doc ID 2206831.1)" from Google,
REM       it told us IOPS can be found in different places of the AWR report:
REM         (1) Instance Activity Stats
REM         (2) IO Profile (Starting with 11gR2)
REM         (3) Load Profile
REM
REM       Instance Activity Stats:
REM       IOPS - (Input/Output Operations Per Second) - This is the sum of "Physical Read Total IO Requests" and "Physical Write Total IO Requests".
REM
REM       IO Profile:
REM       IOPS - Total Requests (This value is the sum of the metrics "Physical Read Total IO Requests Per Sec" and "Physical Write Total IO Requests Per Sec"
REM       from the Instance Activity Stats area).
REM
REM       Load Profile:
REM       Please note that the information displayed here is a subset of the one in the IO Profile area:
REM
REM       Load profile      -> Instance Activity Stats
REM       Read IO requests  -> physical read IO requests
REM       Write IO requests -> physical write IO requests
REM
REM       physical read IO requests:
REM       Number of read requests for application activity (mainly buffer cache and direct load operation) which read one or more database blocks per request.
REM       This is a subset of "physical read total IO requests" statistic.
REM
REM     Last tested:
REM             11.2.0.4
REM             19.3.0.0
REM             21.3.0.0
REM
REM     Purpose:
REM       Typically there saves the average value of "Physical Read Total IO Requests Per Sec" and "Physical Write Total IO Requests Per Sec"
REM       in each of snap_id of the view "DBA_HIST_SYSMETRIC_SUMMARY" (in which the value of its column "metric_unit" is
REM       "Physical Read Total IO Requests Per Sec" and "Physical Write Total IO Requests Per Sec"), here we use the analytic function
REM       "LAG () OVER()" to get the prior snap_id from current snap_id for more clearly showing "IOPS" between these two snap_id.
